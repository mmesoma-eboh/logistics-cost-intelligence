An end-to-end data science and business intelligence project that deconstructed multi-million dollar logistics spend, identified **60%+ cost-saving opportunities**, and built a proactive forecasting model with **98%+ accuracy**.

## 📊 Business Problem
A global specialty logistics business faced unpredictable costs impacting P&L predictability. The business needed to:
- Understand root causes of $200K+ monthly cost variance
- Build accurate forecasting models for budget planning
- Identify specific cost-saving opportunities in logistics operations

## 🎯 Key Achievements
- **98.3% forecast accuracy** for core logistics costs through predictive modeling
- **60% cost reduction opportunity** identified on key shipping lanes
- **$200K+ annual savings** potential through operational improvements
- **Data quality framework** implemented to handle anomalous service fees

## 🛠️ Technical Approach
### Data Collection & Cleaning
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, SQL, Alteryx
- **Data Sources:** TMS (Transportation Management System) - 18 months of shipment data
- **Key Cleaning Steps:**
  - Handled anomalous service fees misclassified as freight charges
  - Created `Cleaned_Billable_Weight` feature to separate freight vs. service costs
  - Implemented data validation rules for service level categorization

### Modeling & Forecasting
- **Stable Cost Identification:** Statistical analysis to identify predictable baseline costs
- **Forecast Model:** Linear regression and time-series analysis for freight cost prediction
- **Validation:** Back-testing against historical data showing 98%+ accuracy
